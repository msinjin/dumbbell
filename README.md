Human Activity Recognition: predicting dumbbell technique success from wearables.

## Background
People regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do with wearable devices, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

This project seeks to determine the potential for real-time user feedback from model-based assessment of the quality, not quantity, of exercise technique.

To this end, six participants were asked to perform dumbbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five different ways while accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell recorded their movements.
